After connecting all pipes and waterblocks, we need to test if it can preserve air pressure. If it can preserve the air pressure more than 15 minutes without moving one line, it means water won't leak from the setup. We actually tested it several times. We debugged several reasons incrementally. 
1. In the first time, we found the air pressure doesn't preserve at all. We found that due to the nature of the pump, it deflates while not running. Therefore, we need remove it from the setup temporarily while testing the setup.
2. Then we found that the hands still move down but slower than the first time. It means it's related to some components not sealed enough. We decompose the whole setup and test them in a smaller and smaller group. In the end, we find that one of our EKWB radiator itself is faulty. After we replaced it, the air pressures keeps the same for a whole day!

Here is the look of the final 6 x 3090 setup.

Let's try `nvidia-smi` in ubuntu.
