Building machine learning stations is one of my hobbies. I started with learning from [Tim's blog](https://timdettmers.com/2018/12/16/deep-learning-hardware-guide/) and [liuliu's blog](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/56701258). With the combined knowledge and hands-on experience, I am confident building machine learning stations of larger scale with watercooling. Although I don't have bandwidth to build a ML station for other people at this moment, you can always refer to [6X3090 Water-Cooled ML station](posts/2021-10-blog-post-4/) or ask me questions by email.


During my free time, I like playing with my cat and exploring good restaurants in town(especially Asian food).
