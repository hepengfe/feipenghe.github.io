Hi! My name is Pengfei He(pronounced as "Ho"), and I also go by Murphy. I obtained my bachelor of science with honors degree major in [ACMS](https://acms.washington.edu) and minor in [Linguistics](https://linguistics.washington.edu).  I have four years of both industry and academic work experiences, and I am currently looking for a full-time machine learning engineer position in the field of Natural Language Processing.

Regarding research, I am also a part-time NLP researcher at UW NLP labs. My research interests lie broadly in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, and currently I interested the following fields:

#### NLP Algorithm
* Instruction tuning ([technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16775))
* Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning in Efficient AI ([technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16775))
* Bring NLP algorithm to Biological Language Processing, particularly protein design.


#### System
* High Performance Training in distributed environment. ([Parallelism Techniques](https://hepengfei.ml/posts/2024-03-20-training_with_parallelism_1/), [Views on data parallelism](https://hepengfei.ml/posts/2024-03-20-data_parallelism/))
* [Building](https://hepengfei.ml/posts/2021-10-blog-post-4/) and maintaining home workstation for SOTA hardware performance.

#### Business Application
* Business application of AI Agent. (Founded [AdaBit AI](https://adabit.ai))
