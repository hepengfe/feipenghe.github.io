Hi! My name is Pengfei He(pronounced as "Ho"), and I also go by Murphy. I obtained my bachelor of science with honors degree major in [ACMS](https://acms.washington.edu) and minor in [Linguistics](https://acms.washington.edu). I am currently working as a full time NLP engineer at [Petuum](https://www.petuum.com) at conducting researches. 
 


My interests lie broadly in Natural Langauge Processing and Machine Learning. I am currently working on knowledge distillation and text generation.


During my free time, I like playing with my cat, flying FPV drone, watching drama while workout on epliticals, skiing down Crystal Mountain, practicing saxphones, building ML machines, explore good restaurants in town(especially Asian food) and play league of legends or video games with my friends on playstation. 


The profile picture is my cat, Riceball. Her nickname is `ballball`.  A mixed breed of Ragdoll and Siamese cat. 

If you find we have a common ground either in research interests or entertainment, don't hesitate to reach me.
