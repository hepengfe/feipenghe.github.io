Hi! My name is Pengfei He(pronounced as "Ho"), and I also go by Murphy. I obtained my bachelor of science with honors degree major in [ACMS](https://acms.washington.edu) and minor in [Linguistics](https://acms.washington.edu). I am currently conducting researches. 
 

 

My interests lie broadly in Natural Langauge Processing and Machine Learning. I am currently working on knowledge distillation and text generation.

You can reach me via email or slack.

The profile picture is my cat, Riceball. A mixed breed of ragdoll and siamese cat.
