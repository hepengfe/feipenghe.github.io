Hi! I'm Pengfei(also go by Murphy), I am currently working as a NLP engineer at [Petuum](https://petuum.com/). I graduated from University of Washington with major in [ACMS](https://acms.washington.edu) and minor in [Linguistics](https://acms.washington.edu). 


My interests lie broadly in Natural Langauge Processing and Machine Learning. I am currently working on text generation and question answering. I am also interested in commonsense reasoning, language and vision pre-training. I am still exploring research topics and open to collaboration.


During my free time, I like playing with my cat, flying FPV drone, watching drama while workout on epliticals, skiing down Crystal Mountain, practicing saxphones, building ML machines, explore good restaurants in town(especially Asian food) and play league of legends or video games with my friends on playstation. 


The profile picture is my cat, Riceball. Her nickname is `ballball`.  A mixed breed of Ragdoll and Siamese cat. 

If you find we have a common ground either in research interests or entertainment, don't hesitate to reach me.
