Hi! My name is Pengfei He(pronounced as "Ho"), and I also go by Murphy. I obtained my bachelor of science with honors degree major in [ACMS](https://acms.washington.edu) and minor in [Linguistics](https://acms.washington.edu). I am currently working as a full time NLP engineer at [Petuum](https://www.petuum.com) and actively contribute to data-centric NLP toolkit [forte](https://github.com/asyml/forte). I am also a part-time NLP researcher at UW NLP labs.

My interests lie broadly in Natural Langauge Processing and Machine Learning. I am currently working on knowledge distillation and text generation.

During my free time, I like playing with my cat and exploring good restaurants in town(especially Asian food). 


The profile picture is my cat, Riceball. A mixed breed of Ragdoll and Siamese cat.
