Hi! My name is Pengfei He(pronounced as "Ho"), and I also go by Murphy. I obtained my bachelor of science with honors degree major in [ACMS](https://acms.washington.edu) and minor in [Linguistics](https://linguistics.washington.edu).  I have four years of both industrial and academic work experiences, and I am currently looking for a full-time machine learning engineer position in the field of Natural Language Processing.

Regarding research, I am also a part-time NLP researcher at UW NLP labs. My research interests lie broadly in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, and currently I am interested in the following fields:

### NLP Algorithm
* Instruction Tuning ([technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16775))
* Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning in Efficient AI ([technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16775))
* Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback. ([RAINIER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03078))
* Bring NLP algorithm to Biological Language Processing, particularly protein design. ([views on Protein Design](), still exploring potential roles/projects.)


### System
* High Performance Training in a Distributed Environment. ([parallelism techniques](https://hepengfei.ml/posts/2024-03-20-training_with_parallelism_1/), [data parallelism](https://hepengfei.ml/posts/2024-03-20-data_parallelism/), [pipeline parallelism](), [GPU communication]())
* [Building](https://hepengfei.ml/posts/2021-10-blog-post-4/), Testing,  Maintaining and Serving Home Cluster with SOTA Hardware Performance.

### Application
* Business Application of AI Agent. (Founded [AdaBit AI](https://adabit.ai), actively developing.)
