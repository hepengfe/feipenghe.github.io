Hi! My name is Pengfei He(pronounced as "Ho"), and I also go by Murphy. I obtained my bachelor of science with honors degree major in [ACMS](https://acms.washington.edu) and minor in [Linguistics](https://linguistics.washington.edu).  I am currently looking for a full-time machine learning engineer position in the field of Natural Language Processing.

Regarding research, I am also a part-time NLP researcher at UW NLP labs. My research interests lie broadly in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, and currently I am working on the following fields:
* Instruction tuning
* Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning in Efficient AI [PEFT for instruction tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16775)
* High Performance Training in distributed environment. [Parallelism Techniques](https://hepengfei.ml/posts/2024-03-20-training_with_parallelism_1/)
* Business application of AI Agent. [AdaBit AI](https://adabit.ai)
* Bring NLP algorithm to Biological Language Processing (in particular protein design).
