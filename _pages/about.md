Hi! My name is Pengfei He(pronounced as "Ho"), and I also go by Murphy. I obtained my bachelor of science with honors degree major in [ACMS](https://acms.washington.edu) and minor in [Linguistics](https://linguistics.washington.edu). I am currently working as a full time NLP engineer at [Petuum](https://www.petuum.com) and actively contribute to data-centric NLP toolkit [forte](https://github.com/asyml/forte). We are currently hiring! Feel free to email me for a referral if you find [positions](https://www.petuum.com/careers#open-positions) you are interested.


Regarding research, I am also a part-time NLP researcher at UW NLP labs. My research interests lie broadly in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, and currently I am working on knowledge distillation and text generation.


I am also experienced at building machine learning stations by learning from [Tim's blog](https://timdettmers.com/2018/12/16/deep-learning-hardware-guide/), and I am confident building machine learning stations of larger scale and/or watercooling. Although I don't have a bandwidth to build a ML station for other people at this moment, you can always refer to [6X3090 Water-Cooled ML station](posts/2021-10-blog-post-4/) or ask me questions by email.


During my free time, I like playing with my cat and exploring good restaurants in town(especially Asian food).


The profile picture is my cat, Riceball. A mixed breed of Ragdoll and Siamese cat.
