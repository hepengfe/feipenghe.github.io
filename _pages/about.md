Hi! I'm Pengfei(also go by Murphy), an undergraduate student major in [ACMS](https://acms.washington.edu) and minor in [Linguistics](https://acms.washington.edu). 

 

My interests lie broadly in Natural Langauge Processing and Machine Learning. I am currently working on text generation and question answering. 
The listing is not exhaustive but I am still exploring and open to collaborate.



The profile picture is my cat, Riceball. Her nickname is `ballball`.  A mixed breed of ragdoll and siamese cat.
