Hi! My name is Pengfei He(pronounced as "Ho"), and I also go by Murphy. I obtained my bachelor of science with honors degree major in [ACMS](https://acms.washington.edu) and minor in [Linguistics](https://linguistics.washington.edu). I am currently working as a full time NLP engineer at [Petuum](https://www.petuum.com) and actively contribute to [forte](https://github.com/asyml/forte), a data-centric NLP toolkit. We are currently hiring! Feel free to email me for a referral if you find [positions](https://www.petuum.com/careers#open-positions) you are interested.


Regarding research, I am also a part-time NLP researcher at UW NLP labs. My research interests lie broadly in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, and currently I am working on knowledge distillation and text generation.
